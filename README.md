# E-commerce-application
Repository about an E-commerce application in Java

In this e-commerce application design project, the idea is to implement an order tracking system using the Observer design pattern. The system tracks orders and notifies two observers: a price observer and a quantity observer. Here are the requirements and their implementation:

Price observer (PriceObserver): If the total cost of the order exceeds $200, a discount of $20 is applied.
QuantityObserver: If the quantity of items in the order exceeds 5, the delivery charge is waived; otherwise, the delivery charge is $10.
